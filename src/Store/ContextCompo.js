Back in 2019, with the release of Android 10, Google updated the Android branding with an all-lowercase logo and a persistent but flat robot alongside the branding.

That aside, what should you expect from the launch event on September 12? As already mentioned in the headline, the highlight of the event (like every September Apple event) will be the latest iPhone lineup, i.e. the iPhone 15 series this time around. We will again get four variants this year, with all models expected to include a dynamic island and a USB Type-C charging port. Yeah, Apple is finally embracing the USB-C port, thanks to pressure from the EU, on its iPhone lineup as well. Another massive change afoot with the upcoming iPhone 15 lineup is the removal of the mute switch. As per rumors, Apple is planning to include an action button, akin to the Apple Watch Ultra, on its new iPhones. It will be reprogrammable and more useful than just a mute switch. Also, expect a minor redesign, a titanium frame on the Pro models, a new A17 Bionic chip on the Pro models, and much more.',

There’s a round display with a slight curve and a no-bezel look. It will also include a rotational crown, along with a secondary physical button. As for the price, there’s no proper word on this but it could be around the price of the Pixel Watch, which starts at $349.9 (~ Rs 29,000).

Even though recent rumors suggested a possible price hike for the iPhone 15 Pro models, it didn’t dampen the excitement. But a new TrendForce report might just change that.',
  innertext : 'A recent 9to5Mac report (via TrendForce) states that Apple is considering increasing the price of the iPhone 15 Pro Max by up to $100, but it might still ship with 128GB of base storage. So, if you plan on buying the iPhone 15 Pro Max, you may need to pay $1,199 for 128GB of storage. However, interestingly enough, this report states that the iPhone 15 Pro will not get a price hike and continue to retail at $999, the same as last year’s iPhone 14 Pro. This is in contrast to what we heard a few days back where both the Pro variants were expected to receive a price hike. Furthermore, the report claims that the top-most iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max variants will max out at 1TB of storage. Now, if the rumors prove to be true and the iPhone 15 Pro Max indeed offers a titanium chassis and a periscope lens, the price hike will make sense. Right now, we cannot comment on the authenticity of these claims and can only wait for Apple to officially launch the iPhone 15 series. But one thing is certain. The iPhone 15 lineup is due to receive some major hardware and software upgrades with the A17 Bionic chipset, iOS 17 features, USB-C fast charging capabilities, support for Thunderbolt 4, and much more.

That’s because MSI already leaked the architecture previously. Right now, we are going to talk about the Cinebench 2024 benchmark score of the Intel Core i9-14900K desktop processor.',
  innertext : 'If you didn’t know, Cinebench 2024 is a new benchmark released by Maxon recently. It is the latest Cinebench version, the previous one being referred to as R23. Now, the Intel 14th Gen Core i9-14900K desktop CPU Cinebench 2024 benchmark scores show that it is definitely faster than the predecessor, but by how much? According to Wccftech.com, their tests reveal a 5% improvement in multi-core scores and essentially no noticeable improvement to the single-core score. The final scores for the new CPU could definitely be higher. This early, pre-release test was performed using an air cooler and the CPU did hit the throttle limit of 100 degrees Celcius. It is also somewhat unclear if the RAM speed was 4800MHz or higher. We know from previous leaks that this CPU is expected to run at 6GHz or higher, and the base clock mentioned here is also higher than the 13900K at 3.19GHz. So, it is important to note that we cannot consider these final performance figures. First of all, this is a new benchmark, and the processor in question (Core i9-14900K) has neither been announced by Intel nor officially released to consumers yet. These are only the pre-release rumored scores. Interestingly, the source of the leak (Chiphell forums) suggests the CPU was found ‘in a tree pit on the side of the road‘ (translation). The source continues to avoid confirming the CPU’s actual model, to leave things vague. However, aligning this leak with the previously leaked specifications (24-cores & 32-threads) clearly shows that this is most probably the 14th Gen Core i9-14900K.',

The new 3nm chipset will be made available for future smartphones, tablets, intelligent cars, and various other devices. It is expected to happen in the second half of 2024.

While retaining the big circular design and looking like the one on the OnePlus 11, this one will feature the revamped ‘H’ branding, dropping the big ‘Hasselblad’ one. I feel this looks cleaner and calls for a minimal look. Another change is the removal of the small steel plate, which was present in the earlier renders. It was suggested that this housed the rumored periscope lens. I don’t know if OnePlus plans on dismissing this inclusion or will position it somewhere else. For those who don’t know, the company also plans to jump onto the ‘periscope lens on a phone‘ bandwagon for better zooming capabilities. It could be a 64MP lens with an OmniVision OV64B sensor.

But, we haven’t heard much in terms of official words from Rockstar, except for the recent earnings call of their parent organization Take Two Interactive, which did reveal a potential 2024/25 release for GTA 6. Now, a new leak reveals that Grand Theft Auto 6 could finally be announced next month, in October 2023. This seems like the perfect time because the 10-year anniversary of GTA V is coming up soon. Moreover, the leak suggests that GTA 6 could launch in October 2024. The source of the leak is X user GTA6posts. The user has regularly shared leaked videos, images, and more content related to Rockstar’s upcoming AAA game, Grand Theft Auto VI. A leaked voice note from Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick is what the leak included, but it has since been taken down due to a copyright strike, and we can no longer hear it. Still, this leak is quite promising. Our earlier coverage of GTA 6’s release date also pointed towards these dates. It seems like the leaks and rumors surrounding Grand Theft Auto VI seem to suggest similar things. GTA 6’s announcement could be happening next month after all! But, the game developers at Rockstar Games have not said anything official yet. So, it is important to take GTA 6 leaks with a grain of salt. Even if this leak points us in the same direction as other reports, it could definitely be fake. By using just a few voice samples, AI can easily generate entirely fabricated words from basically anyone, even politicians. Therefore, it’s possible that it was actually Artificial Intelligence that generated the ‘voice note leak’ attributed to Take Two Interactive’s CEO. But, could the copyright notice mean it’s real?',

In fact, Dune‘s world is so intricate and full of characters, locations and unknown terminology that one of the issues with past adaptations of the novels was that the uninitiated struggled to understand the universe’s dynamics and rules: that was the case with David Lynch’s film, where the initial lack of explanations on the nature of the Sand and the characters’ role within the narrative made it hard for people who hadn’t read the novel to follow our hero’s quest. But what’s really impressive about Dune (2021) is that it’s surprisingly easy to follow: co-writers Denis Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) cleverly weave information into the narrative in a way that ensures we’re immediately able to grasp the essential facts we need to know about a world that never fails to be absorbing and intriguing, as there’s just as much mystery and action to keep us entertained throughout. In fact, it’s easy not to notice that Dune is nearly three hours long, as it’s so effortless to get drawn into an utterly fascinating world we can’t wait to explore, made all the more compelling by the film’s sound design and cinematography, as well as a series of memorable performances that will have your eyes glued to the screen.',

  outertext : 'Wes Andersons signature whimsy and meticulous attention to detail shine in The French Dispatch. This article explores how the film celebrates the art of journalism while weaving together a tapestry of quirky characters and visually stunning vignettes.',
  innertext : 'Wes Anderson’s latest film The French Dispatch was made in an abandoned felt factory outside of Angoulême, in the southwest of France, which, if it wasn’t the absolute truth, would sound like the plot of a Wes Anderson movie. But that’s actually what happened on The French Dispatch, the celebrated director’s ode to both France and the tradition of long-form journalism, loosely based on the archives of The New Yorker. Anderson’s 10-film oeuvre, including The Royal Tenenbaums and The Grand Budapest Hotel, is characterised by meticulous and eclectic production design, a soothing colour palette, a recurring cast of actors – Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray and Frances McDormand to name a few – and an overall air of good-humoured eccentricity, all of which you’ll find in spades in The French Dispatch. Looking to make his first movie in France, Anderson searched for somewhere cavernous, appealingly blank canvas-y, and – crucially – available, that he could transform into a working studio to make his biggest film yet. And here’s where the felt factory comes into the picture. It became the movie’s soundstage-meets-warehouse-meets-workshop-meets-atelier for the duration of filming, overseen by his longtime production designer Adam Stockhausen. Stockhausen’s team hopped around Angoulême, spraying the buildings with water to darken them for the camera. “We were able to cheat a bit and make them feel older and dirtier,” he says, “but then, against that there are explosions of colour” – in particular great splashes of canary yellow.'

  outertext : 'As Daniel Craigs swan song as James Bond, No Time to Die delivers all the action, intrigue, and emotion fans have come to expect. This article reflects on Craigs tenure as 007 and how the film provides a fitting and thrilling conclusion to his iconic portrayal.',
  innertext : 'After months of delays, the 25th official James Bond film is finally here in “No Time to Die,” an epic (163 minutes!) action film that presents 007 with one of his toughest missions: End the era that most people agree gave new life to one of the most iconic film characters of all time. Everyone knows that this is Daniel Craig’s last film as Bond, and so “No Time to Die” needs to entertain on its own terms, provide a sense of finality for this chapter of the character, and even hint at the future of the spy with a license to kill. It would also help a bit to clean up some of the mess left by “Spectre,” a film widely considered a disappointment. All of the boxes that need to be checked seem to drag down “No Time to Die,” which comes to life in fits and starts, usually through some robust direction of quick action beats from director Cary Joji Fukunaga, but ultimately plays it too safe and too familiar from first frame to last. Even as it’s closing character arcs that started years ago, it feels like a film with too little at stake, a movie produced by a machine that was fed the previous 24 flicks and programmed to spit out a greatest hits package. Long gone are the days when a new Bond movie felt like it restarted the character and his universe as a standalone action film. “No Time to Die” seems cut more from the Marvel Cinematic Universe model of pulling from previous entries to create the impression that everything that happens here was planned all along. You don’t really have to have seen the previous four films, but it will be almost impossible to appreciate this one if you haven’t (especially “Spectre,” to which this is a very direct sequel). And so, of course, we start with Vesper, the love of Bond’s life from “Casino Royale.” After a very clever and taut opening flashback scene for Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), the film catches up with James and Madeleine in Italy, where he’s finally been convinced to go see the grave of the woman who continues to haunt him.'

  innertext : 'A quiet, all-American community in upstate New York – a ghost town really, with the clinking of stars and stripes on their flagpoles the only sign, and more importantly sound, of life. When Lee Abbott (John Krasinski) drives past in his pickup, and gets some water and oranges from the general store, it is clear that this is before the monster apocalypse of Krasinski’s A Quiet Place (2018), and the reason for the silence is that most of the town is off Main Street watching a Little League game. Only the news breaking on the store’s television of a cataclysmic event in Shanghai hints at what is to come on this, the carefully captioned Day 1 of invasion. Once these aggressive creatures, blind but with super hearing, arrive destructively in town, the narrative skips to Day 474, catching up to where the first film ended. With Lee now dead, his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) moves her deaf daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds), son Marcus (Noah Jupe) and newborn baby from their farm, armed with new knowledge of the aliens’ sensitivity to certain frequencies. They join the similarly widowed Emmett (Cillian Murphy), and struggle together not only to survive, but also to redeem themselves and to find a new home – all without making any noise. With the monsters’ appearance and modus operandi now already well established, we see much more of the fast, spidery beasts here, including multiple sequences showing just how efficiently they can, despite their relatively small size, cut through people en masse (even if they always seem to slow down when it is main characters being menaced).'

The trailer has arrived one day after the makers of the movie released the first poster on social media which features Stone in a never-seen-before avatar, rocking Cruellas signature two-toned hairstyle, dark lipstick, and smokey eye makeup. The one-minute thirty-three-second trailer takes the audience back to the 1970s sets of London where the young character of Cruella, played by Stone, is seen coming on a path that would transform her into a thief of dalmatian breed puppies. The flick will also feature Emma Thompson, Mark Strong, Paul Walter Hauser, Joel Fry, and Kirby Howell-Baptiste. News reported that initially Cruella was scheduled for a Christmas 2020 release. But, following the start of filming in August 2019, Disney delayed the films release from December 2020 to May 2021. n the first look image, Stone sported de Vils signature two-toned hairstyle, gothic dark eye makeup, and a bold red lip. Dressed in a leather jacket, she could be seen while walking three Dalmatians in the picture, while co-stars Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser could be seen standing in the background.'

I had been on vacation when the movie came out, so as soon as I came back, my hubby and I immediately booked tickets to see it at a local cinema. We managed to find a theater with an UltraScreen DLX and I’m so glad we did, the visuals is as stunning as one would expect from Marvel. Director Destin Daniel Cretton didn’t waste much time to immerse us into the world of Shang-Chi, and having the legendary Hong Kong star Tony Leung as Wenwu didn’t hurt as he absolutely commands your attention as soon as you see him on screen. I’m glad the film skipped the opening credits and went straight into the origin story… chronicling Wenwu’s journey after he obtained the magical ten rings and his unquenchable thirst for power. We’re treated to some stunning fight choreography right from the start, and Mr. Leung is no stranger to martial art movies so it’s so great to see him perform those moves and the 59 year old actor is still as sprightly as ever.'

  innertext : 'Benedict Cumberbatch is perhaps not the first actor that springs to mind when thinking of casting a Western, but under the direction of Jane Campion in her stellar drama “The Power of the Dog,” he’s just what the movie needs. Covered head-to-toe in dirt for most of the film, he embodies a character in a masculine crisis. He has a constant need to prove he s the roughest, toughest leader in a wolf pack of cowboys, possibly to hide his adoration and affection for the long-gone man who taught him more than just how to ride a horse. Phil (Cumberbatch) dominates the pecking order of any room he’s in through cruel remarks and an irreverence towards authority. His eyes are cold as mountain air; his face is a stone façade against the world; his tongue is as sharp as a snake fang. Gone are the quirky and endearing characters that Cumberbatch has played in the past. Here, coiled like a predator in wait, Cumberbatch is perhaps more fearsome than as his deep-voiced villains in “The Hobbit” and “Star Trek Into Darkness.” He moves through the movie like an unsheathed knife, cutting anyone unlucky enough to get close. Cumberbatch’s Phil is the rough and tumble Remus to the movie’s kinder Romulus, his brother George (Jesse Plemons). Where Phil is calloused and mean, George is gentler and more soft-spoken, often at the mercy of his brother’s teasing. At a stop at a restaurant, Phil harshly taunts Rose (Kirsten Dunst), a widow running the joint, and her son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who Phil bullies until Peter walks off the job and leaves his mother in tears. George reaches out to comfort her, and ends up falling for her. This enrages Phil, who takes the loss of his brother to a woman quite badly. He steps up his intimidation of Rose and Peter, like intensifying heat with a magnifying glass. That is, until Peter tries to spend more time with Phil. The unlikely camaraderie unlocks a number of secrets and hidden intentions, changing everyone’s relationship to each other. ',

  innertext : 'To anyone who’s exclaimed in the last ten or so years something like, “Another Spider-Man movie??,” the new film Spider-Man: No Way Home (in theatres December 17) has a pithy reply. It triples down on the Spider-Man movie mythos, synthesising Tom Holland’s third outing in the red and blue wetsuit with characters from two Spider-Man franchises past. It’s a nervy device that could only have worked in these times of comic-book over-saturation, using Hollywood’s troubling repetitiveness to curious, if slight, advantage. n yoking Sam Raimi’s early 2000s trilogy and the oft-maligned Marc Webb pair of adventures from the early 2010s to the current iteration, No Way Home also ties those once innocently discrete films to the sprawling whole of the Marvel machine as it exists today—an act of cross-corporation synergising (between Sony and Disney) so total and audacious, one almost has to respect it. What else might Marvel’s tractor beam pull into the hungry maw of its Borg ship, to be assimilated into the seething collective? Well, to be fair, Spider-Man was always a Marvel property; he just lives at Sony because of deals that long predate Kevin Feige’s Disney-backed conquest of the content cosmos. In that sense, No Way Home is mostly just a triumph of studio executives agreeing on things and actors making their schedules work. A feat unto itself, I suppose. It goes wrong, of course, opening some kind of portal or whatnot to other dimensions—or, in the movie’s parlance, universes—through which villains from past Spider-Man films emerge. Going further than that description would violate a sacred spoiler oath I made in a secret bunker that only movie critics know about, so I won’t say anything about whether or not anyone else comes zipping out of that hole in space-time.',

It’s admittedly quite a jump from the real estate business, but, well, interest rates are sky high. Before you know it, Jaime, tasked with hiding the beetle by Jenny, is looking down at the thing when it sinks itself onto his face and quickly seeps into his body. Gregor’s initial response to changing into a beetle was simply to turn over (“How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense”), but Jaime is afforded no such chance.

  innertext : 'In a grand science fiction tradition, “Don’t Look Up” uses a disaster-movie framework as a metaphor for a reality-based crisis, with a huge comet hurtling toward Earth as a surrogate for indifference to addressing climate change. Yet this star-studded, extremely provocative satire at times veers off course itself, partially undermining its admirable qualities with the broadness of its tone. At its core, writer-director Adam McKay (who wrote the script with journalist/activist David Sirota) delivers a very pointed treatise on the dysfunctional state of current politics and media, in which everyone is so myopic as to be unable to focus on an existential threat. The title reflects the inevitable endpoint of that, with a bury-your-head-in-the-sand approach to impending doom. Understandably alarmed, their findings quickly reach the White House, where the president (Meryl Streep, poorly served by the ridiculousness of her character) is too preoccupied with her endangered Supreme Court pick to focus on what Randall describes as an extinction-level event. After fruitless back and forth, she concludes that they’ll “sit tight and assess” the situation. McKay and Sirota deliver a spot-on attack on how easily distracted people (especially in media) are, fixating on Kate’s hair and clothes and ignoring the substance of her message. As was clearly its intention, “Don’t Look Up” uses satire to spur a conversation about potentially ignoring a crisis until it’s too late.',

Created by the Wachowskis (formerly known as Andy and Larry Wachowskis), the film, which starred Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Ann Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving, followed computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias “Neo”, who uncovers the truth that his reality (called The Matrix) is a simulated reality and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines who control The Matrix program. The Matrix delivered on its premise of a science fiction “Alice in Wonderland”, creating a vivid dystopian future of action and mystery, with Neo taking viewers on an intriguing hunt for purpose and understanding, with the Wachowskis capitalizing on the late 90s action aesthetics and the use of cutting-edge visual effects. The Matrix went on to become a pop culture icon for the next few years, with two sequels were quickly ordered into production, with The Matrix Reloaded being released in summer of 2003 and The Matrix Revolutions later that same year. Both sequels were ambitious projects; expanding upon the original film’s narrative and telling a much larger story. Critics and moviegoers viewed the two sequels as flawed, but still undeniably exciting at times, with the Wachowskis placing a large emphasis on the bleak future and the epic war between humans and machines, creating an enormous blockbuster ending to a saga that began with a simple question of understanding identity.  Now, roughly after eighteen years since the conclusion of The Matrix Revolutions, Warner Bros. Studios and director Lana Wachowski journey back down the proverbial sci-fi “rabbit hole” once again for their fourth installment of this franchise in The Matrix Resurrections. Is this long-awaited sequel movie worth reopening the series again or does it completely miss its mark on what made The Matrix unique with this unnecessary next chapter?'

It is even perceptional. Truth can be normal for the spider, while at the same time, it can be chaotic for the fly. Society believes truth is absolute, but most artists know it doesn’t exist. For us, a lie is the purest form of storytelling, and the truth, in fact, is a lie itself. Akira Kurosawa’s Rashomon explores a similar depth. Influenced by the auteur’s genius, Ridley Scott hunts for the meaning of truth in his 13th-century medieval drama, The Last Duel. Jean, the savage soldier, was born into royalty and was entitled to the captaincy of Fort Belleme, which his family held for generations. On the other hand, Jacques was raised in a church with neither a name nor wealth. Hence he became a man of war and words. Together they fought at the Battle of Limoges in 1370. However, the new Count Pierre d’Alençon (Ben Affleck) had asked the troops to hold the bridge, but Jean attacked the enemies to prove his bravery. Jean saved Jacques’ life but made an enemy by refusing to follow Pierre’s order. With the order of King Charles VI, Pierre became Jean’s overlord and started a campaign to raise war levies. Pierre, impressed with Jacques’s loyalty and courtesy, charged him with collecting the debt. Soon, Jacques visited Jean’s domain to collect the levies. Jean lost half of his workforce, his wife, and his kid to the plague and had little rent collection to pay the debts. But he knew that Pierre wouldn’t listen to his plea or favor him like Jacques. Hence, he decided to embark on another battle, The Battle of Normandy (1380), to raise the capital.After the battle, Robert de Thibouville provided Jean and his men shelter. During dinner, Robert visited Jean with his beautiful daughter, Marguerite. At the battle of Poitiers, Robert sided with the English and betrayed the French king. He bore a traitor’s mark, and thus no one was ready to marry Marguerite. When Jean learned that there was a dowry associated, he didn’t hesitate and asked Marguerite’s hand from Robert to pay his debts to Pierre.'

The two Widows thought their mother figure had perished from injuries sustained during their escape from Ohio, but now their whole family is together again—with all the complex feelings of pain, sorrow, and deeply buried love that comes with such a reunion. This sequence forms the emotional heart of Marvel Studios Black Widow, defying any attempt to classify the film in a single genre.

  outertext : '"Bhuj: The Pride of India" narrates the remarkable story of Indias response to the 1971 Indo-Pak war. This article highlights the valor of the unsung heroes and the films patriotic fervor. Set during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, it follows Indian Air Force Squadron Leader Vijay Karnik — then in-charge of the Bhuj Air Force Base who, with the help of 300 local women of Madhapar Village, reconstructed the damaged landing strip in 72 hours.',
  innertext : 'STORY: During 1971’s Indo-Pak war, 300 Bhuj women risked their lives to restore the bombed Indian Air Force airstrip in Bhuj, so that it stays operational to defend the incoming Pak air and land assault. Encouraging the local women to help repair the airstrip on a war footing was Squadron leader Vijay Karnik (Ajay Devgn). The film recalls the crisis and the contribution of the courageous civilians and the Indian Armed Forces. REVIEW: The India-Pakistan war of 1971 ensued during the Bangladesh liberation war in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). As India aided East Pakistan to end West Pakistan’s (now Pakistan) oppressive regime on it, PAK attacked western regions of India hoping to use it as a bargaining tool to trade against the captured territories in the east. Various Indian air bases were bombed as part of the strategy. The Bhuj airbase was one of the prominent IAF (Indian Air Force) territory that took a massive hit. On the night of December 8, PAF (Pakistan Air Force) jets dropped more than 14 Napalm bombs on the Indian Air Force airstrip in Bhuj. The impact rendered the airstrip useless and the Indian combat aircrafts dysfunctional. The IAF expected the Border Security Force (BSF) to restore the airstrip but time was ticking, and labour was scarce. It was during this time that 300 villagers—mostly women—from Madhapur in Bhuj, decided to step in to defend the country by repairing the damaged airbase within 72 hours. In Bhuj: The Pride of India, director Abhishek Dudhaiya remembers these unsung warriors and the story of their incredible bravery, that deserves to be told. Credit to Ajay Devgn for bringing this act of valour to screen. However, can the execution match the intent? Over the years, the demeanour of Indian war movies has seen a dramatic shift. From chest thumping jingoism to humanising the war heroes and seeing them as people first — we have come a long way. Even Uri: The Surgical Strike (2019) had a restrained sense of personal loss and grief and showed the consequences of war beneath the high josh. War heroes are respected, even revered, but they aren’t projected as invincible anymore. There’s a certain honesty in their heroism. That’s not the case here.'

  outertext : 'Inspired by real events, "The Big Bull" sheds light on the stock market scam of the 1990s. This article dissects the films financial intrigue, Abhishek Bachchans portrayal of Harshad Mehta, and its portrayal of corporate greed.',
  innertext : 'Kookie Gulati’s The Big Bull faces two major disadvantages. The first is that Harshad Mehta, the stock broker who inspired the movie, has already served as the subject of a detailed web series. The second is that the multi-crore securities scam engineered by Mehta in the early 1990s, though by no means negligible, has been followed by other, more sensational frauds. The SonyLIV series Scam 1992 used real names while dramatising actual incidents. The Big Bull invents a new identity for its anti-hero, Hemant Shah, but closely follows the milestones and obstacles in the short but sensational life of India’s most famous stock market manipulator. From Shah’s modest beginnings to his meteoric rise on the Bombay bourse, the media attention to his runs-in with the law enforcement agencies, The Big Bull goes methodically and unimaginatively down the list. The 155-minute Hindi movie, which is being streamed on Disney+ Hotstar, stars Abhishek Bachchan as the stock trader who wants to get very rich very quick. Hemant and his brother Viren (Sohum Shah) quickly graduate from being sub-brokers to independent traders, filling their coffers while surreptitiously emptying out the accounts of the country’s leading banks. Financial journalist Meera (Ileana D’Cruz) is among the few who are sceptical about this trajectory. Hemant’s brother Viren is shown as a reluctant partner in crime, as he unsuccessfully tries to curb Hemant’s instincts. The Indian middle class that benefits from Hemant’s hot tips and risk-taking behaviour cheers him on, as do the businessmen who profit from his bull run. The screenplay, by Kookie Gulati and Arjun Dhawan, is similarly admiring of Hemant’s efforts to bilk the banking system and exploit its loopholes. The sympathy-for-the-devil chronicle finds a convenient villain to blame for Hemant’s excesses – the Congress party, which was in power during Harshad Mehta’s rampage. From the prime minister downwards, the movie suggests, Hemant has powerful backers for his crimes.'

  innertext : 'While Santhoshatinte Onnam Rahasyam and Sara’s explore womens bodily agency, Mimi shuts down the conversation with a tone of judgment Written and directed by Laxman Utekar and co-written by Rohan Shankar, Mimi is a Hindi comedy-drama starring Kriti Sanon, Sai Thamhankar, Evelyn Edwards and Pankaj Tripathi in lead roles. A remake of the Marathi film Mala Aai Vhhaychy! by Samruddhi Porey, Mimi takes us through the life of an Indian surrogate abandoned by the biological parents of the baby at an advanced stage of the pregnancy. Mimi Rathore (Kriti Sanon), is a dancer and aspiring actor residing in Rajasthan. It is Mimi’s life’s dream to move to Mumbai and become a Bollywood star, but she finds herself restricted by financial constraints that delay the relocation. She is approached by John (Aiden Whytock) and Summer (Evelyn Edwards), an American couple who are on the search for a healthy surrogate to bear them a child. With the help of the local taxi driver Bhanu (Pankaj Tripathi), the couple manage to convince Mimi to agree to the surrogacy in exchange for a huge amount of money. Mimi considers this as a chance to pursue her future in the movies. She soon moves into her friend Shama’s ( Sai Thamhankar) house after the pregnancy is confirmed by the doctor. Well ahead into the pregnancy, the doctor diagnoses the possibility of the birth of a child with disability. The couple abandons the surrogacy and leaves the country, asking Mimi to abort the foetus. The rest of the film follows how she chooses to handle this predicament. Surrogacy is an issue that has complex legal, social, financial and moral connotations in a third world country like India. Many women from marginalised, low-income groups often look at it as a viable method to propel themselves and their families out of poverty. It is necessary to invoke this context in order for us to analyse the damage that a mainstream Bollywood film like Mimi does to the conversations on the bodily autonomy of women with the way it handles the theme.'

  outertext : 'Bell Bottom combines Akshay Kumars charisma with a gripping espionage thriller. This article examines the films period setting, Akshays role as a suave spy, and the adrenaline-pumping action sequences.',
  innertext : 'Going to the cinema after nearly a year is truly an enthralling experience – Dolby sound and on the big screen the dashing Akshay Kumar in his latest commercial release. With that steely moustache, Anshul (Kumar) makes an entry that is worth the audience whistles. By now we all know that this is Akshay’s ‘undercover agent’ look. Dressed in his retro bellbottoms, Anshul pretends to be doing a boring government desk job while secretly working for the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) – India’s espionage wing. Based on the countless hijackings of Indian passenger aircraft that were taking place, Ranjit Tiwari’s espionage thriller takes us through India’s political ties with Pakistan and the Middle East. In the two hours, the film captures the incognito turmoil stewing in the midst of India’s seemingly cordial relations with neighbouring Pakistan during the era of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s (Dutta). Anshul and his team of spies are sent on a covert mission to rescue 210 hostages held by an anti-national group secretly funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). From Amritsar to Lahore to finally landing on the tarmac at Dubai, the hijacked Indian Airlines flight is carefully being watched by the triad of nations. Tiwari builds the momentum but sadly leaves us with a rather silly climax, with Anshul dodging a sandstorm. Kumar’s physique and his poker face are the perfect pegs for the role. Dutta’s prosthetic artists have done a remarkable job, leaving no room for ambiguity. And my favourite, Adil Hussain, can pull off any character with pristine devotion. This one reminding me much of ‘Ek Tha Tiger’s’ Shenoy sir. Let’s not forget to mention that once again the vast UK landscape has attracted the Bollywood crew to Scotland. So, if you are looking for a pinch of drama, action and wee romance, ‘Bell Bottom’ is now screening in cinemas and is expected on Amazon Prime in the coming weeks.'

  outertext : 'The sequel to the 2007 hit, "Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2," brings back the perfect blend of comedy and mystery. This article discusses how the film captures the essence of its predecessor while introducing fresh thrills and chills.',
  innertext : 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 features Tabu, Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani in the lead roles. In supporting roles, we also get to see our Chota Pandit aka Rajpal Yadav and Sanjay Mishra. Kartik Aaryan’s entry is designed to establish him as the leading man and the centre of attraction. With a cheeky reference to M. Night Shyamalan’s masterpiece, The Sixth Sense, Ruhan (Kartik Aaryan), claims that he can see dead people and he has grown up around ghosts. A few quick cuts and hurried glimpses and one can make it out that the film is big on production designs and boasts of one or multiple romantic songs. As Ruhan and Reet (Kiara Advani) continue to sail smoothly on their love-boat, Manjulika comes knocking. Despite several warnings from Tabu, whose character is a rather sincere one from amongst the lighter ones, Ruhan and Reet don’t shy away from mocking the spirit of Manjulika. Things take a drastic turn and Manjulika takes over Reet. Kartik Aaryan has his own humour touch and he seems to have brought that in his role. As he takes over to fight the spirit in the Haveli and bring back Reet to normalcy, it’ll be interesting to see how does this installment differ from the original, if it does at all. We hear the classic “Hare Raam” tune from the original and that’s sheer, much welcomed nostalgia. Akshay Kumar’s and Vidya Balan’s film went onto become a cult-classic. And those are big shoes to fill. Vidya Balan as Manjulika in “Mere Dholna” did leave a mark and has stayed with us through these years. In this second installment, it is Kiara Advani in the role. As sweet and enchanting she is as Reet; we have already been warned in her intro ‘to not be fooled by her sweetness.’ From the trailer, Manjulika fits in the Bollywood’s definition of witches and ghosts. The trailer has also created the buzz around the role of Tabu in the film. The impression that the film makers have apparently made by casting the national awardee is that she indeed has an important part. Otherwise, it will be disappointing. From the trailer, she is the only one who seems scared and bothered by the spirit in the haveli. A sequel to a successful film is a lot of responsibility in itself. With this trailer, we cannot resist comparing it to its prequel. But the present star cast is also equally compelling. While the background and the setting of the film seems to be similar, we expect more from the story and the history of the Haveli.'

I was looking forward to watching Anek but when it released its time in the theater was so short that I had to wait for its release on Amazon Prime.',
  innertext : 'Anek is about India’s north-eastern states. The story revolves around separatists who don’t believe their voices are being heard by the politicians of Delhi. Ayushmann Khurrana plays an undercover government agent, Aman, who is sent to the north eastern states to ferret out information about faction groups. As cafe-owner Joshua, he gets to know the locals and starts seeing their point of view. Aido (Andrea), is a friend of Joshua’s. She is a boxer and wants to compete for India so that when she’s on the world stage people will listen to her voice about the injustice meted out to her people. Her father meanwhile, as the head of one of the militant groups feels that there is no hope in talks with the Indian government and that violence is necessary. In the mix also are the politicians – the wily minister (Kumud Mishra) and his right hand man Abrar Bhatt (Pahwa) who want to sign a peace accord with one of the larger militant groups, the Tiger Sangha. The many layers to the story become clear to us little by little. Given that the topic is complex, and the film a little dense, the viewer is left to his own means to piece together the story. Having a voice-over, or even a character narrating the story (maybe as a flashback), would have really helped make the film and the film’s core issue more approachable and understandable for the average movie-goer. The film is told from the point of view of the north easterners, estranged from the Indian mainland and facing racism even as Indian citizens. The politicians are shown as wanting a peace accord accord but not really caring about long-term resolution. In the middle is Joshua who comes into this initially at the behest of his politician masters, but then makes up his own mind. Ayushmann Khurrana looks very different from his usual self and his acting is not as good – there was this particular mode he seemed to go into at times, where I could not tell if his character was angry or frustrated or just plain at his wit’s end. Northeastern actress Andrea Kevichusko is quite good and the supporting cast also does well. While the film is earnest and tries to tell some truths it can’t get across its message in an interesting fashion. Anek suffers from clunky writing and lackluster storytelling.'

  innertext : 'Weddings are divine and more of a festival in India and hence, divorce often leads to conversations and evokes emotions that none can ascertain. Raj Mehta tries to dwell into the tale of two divorce in the same family, but with a comical twist in his writing. He sets up the plot by establishing how problems seep into the lives of childhood lovers, Kukoo (Varun Dhawan) and Naina (Kiara Advani), after their wedding. After 5 years of marriage, they decide to part ways, but the real conflict begins, when Kukoo discovers that his father, Bheem (Anil Kapoor) is also planning to leave his wife, Geeta (Neetu Kapoor), as he has found love in Meera (Tisca Chopra). The core plot and conflict of Jug Jugg Jeeyo is actually a drama, but Raj Mehta along  with his writers, Sumit Batheja and Anuraj Singh, have designed his screenplay in a manner that every heavy sequence is followed up with something light. You reach the peak of drama, and then comes a one-liner thats sure to bring a smile. While this is a subject that easily could have been on the heavier side, its the writing that ensures a blend of laughter, emotion and drama. Of course, Jug Jugg Jeeyo is not flawless. The core premise of the film is indeed for the urban audience, without extending to the desi cinema going viewers. Theres an episode in the pre-climax (details avoided for spoilers), that could have been avoided. Its a bold step taken by the makers, but the middle class junta might be a little disconnected. The editing is fine, which ensures a fast paced narrative. The cinematography is colourful and its exactly the kind of visual that will create the urge for big screen experience. The dialogues by Rishhabh Sharma are excellent. The one-liners written specially for Maniesh Pauls character is sure to bring the house down with laughter, whereas some of the emotional ones have the depth thats needed to tackle the rather heavier sequences of the film. The music is top notch, and blends well into the narrative. The placement of Naach Punjaban in the second half lifts the tempo of the film, and its a wedding song experience that we have been missing for a while on the big screen.',

Akshay Kumar is gearing up for the release of his film ‘Raksha Bandhan’ on 11 August which is on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan. The movie is directed by Aanand L Rai and apart from Akshay Kumar the movie stars Bhumi Pednekar, Sahejmeen Kaur, Deepika Khanna, Sadia Khateeb, and Smrithi Srikanth.The movie is a family drama and it revolves around a brother and his 4 four sisters. Already the movie is pretty hyped up because it is clashing with Aamir Khan’s Lal Singh Chaddha. Akshay Kumar’s Raksha Bandhan has a poster with four girls embracing the actor in what looks like a heartwarming moment between a brother and his sisters.

Will Babloo be able to stop him? REVIEW: With ripping muscles, crisp six-pack abs, high-octane action, and double dhamaka, Babloo is back with his Heropanti. To be honest, the premise is predictable: Babloo is an unstoppable one-man army on a mission to track down the baddies and kick their a**es off in order to protect the world from cyber-crime. But apart from this basic plotline, Sajid Nadiadwala’s franchise Heropanti 2, serves up a lot more for the action-movie buffs. After directing the Baaghi franchise, Ahmed Khan reunites with Tiger Shroff. And, as with his previous films, the story takes a back seat to the prospect of watching a hot hunk engage in a high-octane stunt duel. The first half is a little off-kilter and takes a while to settle in, post-interval one can expect a lot of stunts, thrills, twists and just enough masala and explosions to keep you entertained. The film excels in action set pieces by Ram Chella- Lakshman Chella, Parvez Shaikh & Kecha Khamphakdee, but it also delivers some unbelievable action choreography in which the hero and even his phone survive a major explosion. Eventually, Rajat Arora’s writing falls flat and takes the audiences sensibility for granted. The story tries to be overwhelmingly larger than life, but in the process, it loses logic and becomes preposterous. Laila, a hobbyist magician and cybercrime kingpin, is on the verge of robbing the Indian government. CBI has hired Babloo to prevent this calamitous event from happening. Will Babloo be able to catch Laila, who always seems to be ten steps ahead of everyone?

  outertext : 'A new Bollywood film - 83 - tells the story of Indias historic win of the 1983 cricket world cup. Sports journalist Ayaz Memon, who travelled to England to cover the tournament, recalls Indias heady journey to cricketing glory.',
  innertext : 'The opening scene of the movie, 83, takes us back to arguably the most iconic catch in Indian cricket’s history. Kapil Dev running backwards from mid-wicket and pulling off a stunner to dismiss Vivian Richards off Madan Lal had changed the 1983 World Cup final. Back in 1983, the Indian audience had missed the live action of that catch, thanks to Doordarshan’s customary ‘rukawat ke liye khed hai’ impediment. But through several replays and video playbacks, it was etched on our collective memories. Ranveer Singh didn’t have the license to err. From his running steps to catching style and technique, his recreation of the magical moment on celluloid was unblemished. If you go to the movie to watch Ranveer, you will be disappointed, for you will get Kapil Dev instead. Indian sports films, cricket especially, had kept the game’s nitty gritties, its technical aspects, at arm’s length until Sushant Singh Rajput did some course correction in MS Dhoni: The Untold Story. In ’83’, the challenge for director Kabir Khan and his team was bigger. Here, they were dealing with an entire team, not an individual. For a team as iconic as the Class of 83, batting techniques and bowling actions offered almost zero cinematic license to change. The toughest part was to get Sunil Gavaskar right, that impeccable stance and the straightness of the bat. Tahir Raj Bhasin, playing the ‘Little Master’, is first-class. The movie cared to show nets sessions as well, Gavaskar berating Balwinder Sandhu and telling him to hide his grip while bowling inswingers. The words turned out to be prophetic, as Sandhu deceived Gordon Greenidge in the final with an incoming delivery, the West Indies opener shouldering arms and getting cleaned up. The near-accuracy in the film comes from extensive research, a huge amount of hard work and the honest intention of not letting the World Cup-winning team and the fans down. The ’83’ team roped in Sandhu and retained him throughout the filmmaking period to advise on technical details of all the players. During a recent interaction, the former medium fast bowler spoke about how he walked a tightrope, with little margin for error. Sandhu spoke on a lighter note, but Ranveer was serious when he heaped praise on the former.'

  innertext : 'The rise of veganism has led to a shift in the global food landscape. As more people adopt veganism, the demand for vegan food products has increased. This has led to a growth in the plant-based meat industry. The global market for plant-based meat is expected to surpass $34 billion by 2030. The shift towards veganism is fueled by a growing consciousness around health, environmental sustainability, and animal welfare. The production of plant-based foods requires less land, fewer resources, and produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Research shows that the carbon footprint of a vegan diet can be as much as 60% smaller than a meat-based one. The food industry has responded to the rise of veganism by offering more plant-based options. This has triggered a wave of competition and innovation in the meat and dairy industry. A seismic shift towards healthier living is reshaping the global food landscape, with a soaring demand for gluten-free, organic, natural, and plant-based or vegan food products. This transformation is sending ripples through the meat and dairy industry, triggering a wave of competition and innovation. A surge in conversations around sustainability and plant-based options is further propelling this trend, promising a brighter future for both the environment and human health. This paradigm shift is redefining consumer preferences and leaving an indelible mark on the meat and dairy industry. The consumption of plant-based products, ranging from almond, cashew, coconut, flaxseed, oats, and pea-based yogurts, is capturing the spotlight. Renowned for their gut-boosting properties and live probiotic cultures, these vegan yogurts are becoming a staple for health-conscious individuals seeking wholesome alternatives. As the plant-based yogurt market gains momentum, its growth trajectory is poised for stratospheric expansion. The nascent stage of its lifecycle presents remarkable opportunities for developing nations to embrace this revolutionary trend and contribute to a more sustainable future.'

  innertext : 'Farm to table dining is a social movement where restaurants source their ingredients from local farms. This movement calls on consumers to choose natural, often organic, locally produced foods over imported or processed alternatives. Farm to table restaurants emphasize the use of local and seasonal ingredients in their menus. They directly source ingredients from local farms and producers instead of relying on mass-produced goods. The farm to table movement has grown in 2020. As concern for health and sustainable eating rise, so does the desire for the freshest, most flavorful, and locally grown ingredients. Farm to table is a movement that promotes locally grown, and/or organic food. The idea is that our meals should be based on where we live and what we eat. By eating home-grown foods, we are able to support the local community and prevent food miles from polluting our environment. With the rise of farm to table, it has been easy for consumers to change their lifestyles by becoming more active in their food choices. However, theres still more work to be done in order for us to truly have an impact on our planet. Here are some ways you can help promote farm to table in your community. We are finally seeing the farm-to-table movement in major cities. The movement was started by chefs who wanted to make the best ingredients possible to offer their customers a more flavorful dining experience. This led to the idea of offering food from local producers and seasonal ingredients, which is now seen in many restaurants across America. The farm-to-table movement is just one example of how businesses are making a shift from mass production and capitalism towards sustainable practices that meet the needs of people, animals, and our planet. The movement focuses on the importance of nutrition. It closes the gap for mass produced and processed ingredients. Fresh ingredients not only clean up the reputations of dirty dining but redeems restaurants worldwide when implementing farm to table concepts. Fresh food is replacing fast food. Its time for the U.S. to tune up their kitchens with what customers are asking for! Local food farms are essential for food safety and satisfaction'

  outertext : 'Ghost kitchens, or delivery-only restaurants, have grown significantly during the pandemic. They are restaurants that dont offer dine-in services and are built to fulfill online orders. Their menus are only available to customers that require delivery. Ghost kitchens typically have no visible storefront and use third-party apps like Grubhub, UberEats, and DoorDash, or their own delivery operation',
  innertext : 'Ghost kitchens have been around for a while, but indoor dining restrictions during the pandemic have propelled their growth. In 2021, BentoBox alone saw a 60x increase in ghost kitchens. Ghost kitchens have lower operating costs because they dont have front-of-house staff. They also have lower rent costs because they are smaller spaces. These cost savings give ghost restaurants some financial flexibility to operate and adapt to changing circumstances. Ghost kitchens could change the way the industry does business for years to come. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the adoption of ghost kitchens and the creation of virtual brands. Both were seen as potential fixes for restaurants caught in a highly unusual predicament. Some eateries were coping with surging delivery orders, while others were looking a lifeline as government restrictions clamped down on dining capacity and slashed sales. But these once-creative solutions have been replicated too many times, at times, diluting their effectiveness. Ghost kitchens, which are also known as cloud or dark kitchens, allow restaurants to prepare food solely for delivery. This can be critical for businesses seeing strong demand as consumers’ appetite for food delivery grows. Third-party food delivery sales grew 138% in December, according to analytics firm Second Measure. Start-ups like Kitchen United or Travis Kalanick’s CloudKitchens house multiple restaurant brands within one location and tout their models as more efficient, lowering labor and rent costs for eateries. Meanwhile, virtual restaurant brands are found only on third-party delivery apps, relying on those platforms for marketing rather than a physical storefront. Food from these brands is made either in a traditional restaurant kitchen or in a dark kitchen. For some struggling or failing restaurants, virtual brands have turned out to be lifesaver.'

  outertext : 'Taste is the result of substances landing on the receptors of the tongue which activate receptor signaling. One of the breakthrough moments for the science of flavor was the discovery of the five different basic taste receptors [8] – sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami (umami is also often referred to as “savory”). Flavor is caused by receptors in the mouth and nose detecting chemicals found within food. These receptors respond by producing signals that are interpreted by the brain as sensations of taste and aroma.',
  innertext : 'When you bite into pani puri, also called golgappa or phuchka, the dominant aroma of cumin and mint, the sour tang of the amchoor, the heat of the green chillies and the satisfying crunch of the puri contrasting with the soft and creamy texture of the filling (which varies by region) is what makes up the entirety of the pani puri experience. Flavour is a combination of taste, smell, mouthfeel, and to a smaller extent, sound and visual experiences. And despite the fact that 80 per cent of flavour perception happens in the nose, we tend to associate the tongue as being the Watson and Crick of flavour to the nose’s Rosalind Franklin. Let’s start with taste. Our tongues have taste buds that can detect five primary tastes. Contemporary research tells us that the old picture of the map of the tongue, with distinct taste perception areas, is mostly wrong, and that while the tip of your tongue does have more taste buds dedicated to detecting sweet and salty flavours, it doesn’t mean that they cannot detect sourness or bitterness entirely. Taste bud specialization is reasonably well distributed. Sweetness and saltiness are detected rather quickly, while bitterness, which is mostly detected at the back of the tongue, takes a bit longer and tends to linger in the mouth. This explains the expression ‘bitter aftertaste’. Sourness tends to be detected more strongly on the sides of the tongue. In the overcrowded world of Instagram recipes, one does find gems that make it to the ‘Saved’ list immediately. This week, I discovered tuppada mutagi on the social media platform. Its a flatbread from North Karnata made with jowar flour, laden with ghee, and smeared in spices. I had been hearing a lot about Doki’s on-the-go snacks. I finally tried their buffalo jerky, which is dried and spiced and comes with simple ingredients in the marinade: olive oil, curry leaf powder, salt, soy sauce and onion powder, among other things. The Kerala Fry flavour is the one to try for sure: It’s spicy yet delicious. It’s almost like a taste of Kerala— my mother, a true Malayali at heart, agreed with this. The only downside is that you need to refrigerate it after the pack is opened or finish it in three days. I also found the price, 199, to be slightly on the higher side given the serving is just 30g—a little too less for my liking. Despite that, this is a fun option for those looking for something different for a midday snack. —Nitin Sreedhar'

A tourist’s itinerary is incomplete without a meal, no matter the packed schedule or the point of interest, one will find time to enjoy the local cuisine. This meal could happen at a fancy diner with companions, or savouring local delicacies at street hawkers while strolling on the streets. The venue and choice of food might vary but the activity that is constant is travellers do is take pictures of their meals, which serves as their memory of a destination they travelled to. Revisiting these pictures, they relive the delicious food they devoured and the stories attached to it. The food they have is not about satisfying their hunger, it’s about sharing the eating habits of different ethnicities and cultures that nurture the habit of global exploration. This experience is the sum total of what Culinary tourism is all about; exploring cultures and bridging gaps. Let’s see the first thing that comes to your mind at the mention of Italy. No points for guessing! Italy is synonymous with Pizza, Pasta, gooey mozzarella and other lip-smacking delicacies. Specific cuisines representing their country of origin is a general fact. The mere mention of a country unleashes the taste of their prominent food in our minds. Sampling the local cuisine of a destination is one of the key desires for a traveller while visiting a country, which is not an alien phenomenon. The target of tasting the local delicacies is the first thing on a traveller’s mind after making it to the destination. Over time, the changing preferences have resulted in intensifying these gastronomic escapades, enabling destinations to emphasise sampling their exotic delights and wine for which they need to be explored. The range, taste, flavours and diversity of cuisines on offer worldwide is enormous. There are some globally-renowned examples of cuisines related to their country of origin. The British fish n chips, which are typical to the isle’s charm, the assortment of legendary pasta, pizzas, spaghetti, lasagne, and mozzarella cheese are synonymous with Italy, and the Japanese have their sushi, seaweeds and fishes luring people over from across oceans and Thailand with its world-famous hot and spicy mix of rice, chilly, chicken, bamboo shoots, herbs and seafood are all pioneers of Culinary tourism.'

Craft breweries are cropping up worldwide, offering beer aficionados a plethora of options beyond the conventional lagers and pilsners. Craft Beer is characterized by its meticulous brewing process. Artisanal brewers use traditional methods, often with a modern twist, to create beers that are a true reflection of their passion and expertise.',
  innertext : 'Craft beer, the result of craft brewing and the succession of the late twentieth century micro brewing movement is defined as relatively small, independently-owned commercial breweries that use traditional brewing methods with an emphasis on flavour and quality. Sound good? The majority of the beer drinking population think so. The craft brewing process takes time with many considering it an art by the brewmasters. The result is a wide range of experimental flavours, something large scale commercial brewers tend to avoid. Up until recently mind. The likes of Diageo have release Hop House – a craft beer or lager of sorts with crisp, full-flavoured subtle malty notes and fresh hop aromas with hints of Apricot and Peach. The Guardian reported in 2017 that the craft beer boom has pushed the number of UK breweries past two thousand. With more than 300 new breweries launched in the UK during 2016. The reason; our infatuation with craft beer. Encouraging startups to spring up all over the UK and beyond. Available in specialist ale houses, traditional pubs and supermarkets across the country. Our access to craft beer is ever-growing. From authentic Czech-style pilsners and flavoursome golden ales with ABV’s as low as 3.8%, to tantalising India pale ales (IPAs) and bold export porters and regal stouts. The truth is that there is such an amazing volume of variety that for those of you who think you don’t like craft beer, then you need to keep looking because there will be one that suits your tastes.If you look back around seventy years the beer market was in a similar position here in the UK. Independent brewers a plenty. But during the seventies, traditional British beer and variety began shrinking as the big breweries bought out small to medium ‘craft’ brewers and pushed keg bitter and mass produced lager into our public houses. The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) formed in 1971 rescued the ‘craft’ industry in part but failed to deliver a stylish, modern image. Fortunately, in 2002 Gordon Brown introduced the Progressive Beer Duty, which gave tax breaks to brewers below a certain size. And as such, smaller ‘craft’ brewers began to re-emerge. '

Three-quarters now rate their cooking skills as moderate or above – and nearly one in five say they are advanced. Lack of time and inspiration – and the need to clean up – act as the biggest barriers to home cooking for consumers. Demand for convenience in-home is on the rise, leading to opportunities for packaged foods, especially tomatoes and vegetables, along with ready-made sauces and soups, packaged liquid broth, liquid creams and other such “home-cooking helpers”. Globally, consumers use these kitchen helpers very frequently, with a skew towards younger age groups and males with lower cooking skills. The most used home-cooking helpers are dressings, vegetables, tomatoes and sauces, which are appreciated because they save time, they taste good, as well as adding versatility and “simplifying my life”. Sharing and togetherness are also significant emotional benefits, with “chance to control” playing its part too. Most respondents purchase these products at the supermarket, mainly driven by price, availability and flavour variety, in this exact order. From a packaging point of view, storage, hygiene, functionality and product protection are the most relevant attributes. We tested nine different home-cooking helper concepts on consumers, all of which registered good overall appeal. With sauces and soups performing best on relevance and purchase intent, meal kits and exotic ready meals scored highest for uniqueness. Generally, the key barriers to overcome include concerns around the healthiness, naturalness and freshness of packaged products, compared with unpackaged ingredients.'

Five years ago, the European Union enacted a regulation requiring food preparers to list or label any of 14 allergens, from peanuts and tree nuts on down to mollusks, sulfites and lupin. Enforcement is uneven, but its not unusual to encounter a menu that lists all 14 allergens, pointing out which dishes contain one or more of them. In the U.S., food manufacturers are required to list the eight most common allergens on packaging, but some increasingly common allergens — like sesame — dont need to be noted, though the FDA is rethinking that. Theres no federal regulation requiring allergen disclosure in restaurants. Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island require restaurants to display food allergy awareness posters, which include reminders to patrons to inform servers of any allergies they may have. Michigan and Virginia require restaurants to have at least some personnel trained in food safety, including allergen awareness. In a statement to NPR, the National Restaurant Association said it now offers its members training on allergens as part of its food safety program, noting that U.S. restaurants know its both an increasing concern and a potential liability issue.'

  outertext : '“Ethical eating” refers to the consideration of the economic, social and environmental impacts of purchasing or consuming foods and beverages. The role of ethics has become increasingly prioritized for both the food and agriculture industry and the value-driven consumer. Ethical eating can help minimize ecosystem disruption in the agricultural sector. Some people also adopt ethical eating habits to protect human and animal rights.',
  innertext : 'For years, the number-one driving factor behind consumer food choices has been taste. However, over time, value-driven consumers are weighing additional considerations, including social justice, animal welfare and environmental stewardship — all which influence their food and beverage purchasing habits. As awareness and action continue to evolve, the idea of “ethical eating” is becoming increasingly more mainstream. While there have been significant improvements in animal welfare, social justice and environmental stewardship, further opportunities exist. Industry and consumers can work together to make progress toward a more sustainable and ethical supply chain. While importing foods can support international relations and help bring steady income to small farmers and growers overseas, it also means that some relevant regulation often falls outside of U.S. jurisdiction. Challenges associated with imported foods include less-robust labor standards and enforcement than what is generally found in the U.S. Violence, forced labor and extortion have been observed, as individuals and groups compete for commodities and their associated profits. For example, the seafood industry has been under scrutiny for human rights abuse in the supply chain, primarily driven by the presence of forced labor. According to a 2018 report from the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service, “Thailand has been listed as a country with prevailing problem of human trafficking and illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing (IUU).” Pressure from other countries, including the United States, has limited some of their fishing activity and measures, along with increased awareness of IUU in Asia-Pacific countries, have been implemented by agencies in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.',

Today, the social media posts have a direct impact on the kind of food that we eat- the recent example being excessive use of Quinoa, millets and gluten-free food. The rising popularity of vegetarian and vegan recipes is one true case in point. With this, technology is gradually impacting the way we eat and most importantly, the kind of food that we eat. Personalized nutrition is a growing market since it is being demanded by people, with technology coming into play people are now using devices to monitor their body functions which is more precise way to keep a check as it gets better with AI and digital applications develop and to also monitor the impact their diet is having on their body. It is safe to say that technology has disrupted our life’s in many ways than one can imagine, it has changed the way we eat, communicate, showcase our lives on social media and most important how we live our life. Moreover, technology has supported and changed the way of counselling for nutritionists. Today, many people are already aware about the required protein levels, carbohydrates, vitamin levels and know the importance of gluten, proteins etc in their diet, thanks to these ‘lifestyle gurus’.

  outertext : 'As recently as 2018, according to the Global Health & Fitness Association, the fitness industry was worth an estimated $94 billion — a valuation that fluctuated wildly with the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020. Since then, fitness brands and gym chains have scrambled to adapt to a new reality where digital, remote exercise options replaced traditional in-person workouts.',
  innertext : 'ClassPass, one of the world’s largest distributors of remote class options to fitness clubs, currently has over 30,000 club partners in the U.S. alone, with a presence in over 27 other countries, demonstrating the demand for the ability to work out from anywhere. As fitness executives accept that virtual exercise is becoming a permanent fixture rather than a passing trend, new methods of fitness training, such as live video classes and home workouts, will become more common. These forms of training will need to be guided by fitness professionals who understand the relationship between health and technology in the modern era, something a dedicated education in exercise science can offer to aspiring fitness experts. Video classes and home workouts were around before COVID-19, but the pandemic helped popularize them. According to a 2020 study by ClubIntel, 54% of 2,000 surveyed individuals either froze their gym memberships or canceled them altogether. This, combined with the mass closing of gyms in the months following the initial lockdown, allowed existing producers of virtual exercise content (such as fitness-centric YouTube channels) to fill the void with their own home workouts. As a result, online fitness enthusiasts helped audiences keep up their routines in spite of the drop in in-person attendance. The shift to digital platforms allowed people to customize their workouts more than they might in a gym class, since they could form playlists of different workout types to target particular fitness goals. But that wasn’t the only change to fitness: The lack of gym equipment at home paved the way for bodyweight exercises, isometric routines, yoga, and improvised workout tools to take center stage. People were now training their bodies in ways they might never have before, improving their understanding of how to maintain  fitness lifestyle. A hybrid approach to physical fitness that includes in-person attendance and virtual exercise options is only the beginning of the move to a more diverse health experience. As COVID-19 lockdowns end and more gyms reopen to the public, fitness facilities are shifting focus.'

  imageUrl : 'https://builtwithscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Force-Muscle-Growth-1-1.jpg',
  outertext : 'Research has shown that theres a strong relationship between resistance training volume and muscle growth. More volume builds more muscle, but only to a point. Doing too much leads to overtraining and ultimately, you even go backwards (the volume-muscle growth relationship is a U-shaped curve). The standard way to track volume is with volume load, which is sets X reps X weight in pounds or kilos (aka tonnage). But counting sets ("hard" work sets) has been proposed as an additional or alternative method of tracking volume thats simpler.',
  innertext : 'A recent meta-analysis analyzed 14 studies and concluded that tracking sets can indeed be used to quantify volume and predict muscle gains as long as a few conditions are met. First, its well-established now that between 10 and 20 hard work sets per body part per week is ideal for muscle gains. Make an important note: you can make gains with less than 10 sets. But current science says that 10 sets per body part per week is the minimum if you want to optimize. Second, you can gain muscle training in a variety of rep ranges. To produce similar muscle growth, the reps should be at least 6 and ideally not more than 20. Its possible to make gains in the 20 to 35 rep range, but its not ideal or practical. You can also make muscle gains in the 1 to 5 rep range, but this is also not practical when your goal is hypertrophy, not powerlifting. Third, the sets should be taken close to failure (1 to 3 reps in reserve). They must be hard / intense efforts (warm up sets dont count). The bottom line is that the number of weekly sets you do per muscle group is an excellent metric to count both for knowing that you are hitting optimal benchmarks and for tracking progression. The science is clear on this today: training to failure is not mandatory for building muscle. Beginners especially can make excellent gains in muscle size without training to failure or even having to train really close to failure. But as you gain training experience, it gets more important to make sure your intensity of effort is high enough. Going all-out on some sets may boost your gains from good to optimal. However, training to failure must be done judiciously. Studies show that pushing all out to failure (where you cant do another rep with good form) causes more muscle damage, increases recovery time, and may increase fatigue during a workout so that your performance in the back end of your training session may suffer (your volume load may go down because you blasted too hard, too much and or too soon).'

Exercising during a pandemic may seem boring and a struggle, but it is important to do so to stay active, avoid mental health problems (stress, anxiety, depression), boost our immunity, and not gain weight due to overeating(seen increasingly during a pandemic). Even doing little exercises during a pandemic at home can make a huge difference in how you feel. Here are some of the exercises during the pandemic to do when distancing yourself from society. If you do a series of these exercises, then take a break for 10 minutes at a time,” 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off, “she says,” You’re going to be sweating, and you’re going to feel it all over your body. Try doing fifteen air squats, twenty lateral bounds, and a bear crawling five times to one side, then five times to the other, repeating the seven-minute series. Alternating reverse lunges, squat jumps, elbow planks when reaching out with each arm, and keeping a bear crawl position for 20 seconds each followed by 10 seconds of rest per workout, try doing the following four times. A wall sitting, a wall sitting with reach, a hollow body hold, and a Superman position for 30 seconds each, followed by 30 seconds of rest after all of them, try to do the following four times. Youtube offers a wide variety of fitness and training workout channels where you can find your exercise routine according to your preferences.

The recent launch of ChatGPT has opened up more new avenues in the field of technology and has shown how AI is certainly the next big thing. Ever since the pandemic, fitness has got a new definition and many fitness apps have flooded into the market. The fitness sector has carefully incorporated AI technology and reached thousands of people. The easy access to information regarding health and fitness made people more inclined to this technology. From helping to track down your progress, to count how many steps you walked in a day, or helping to track your menstrual cycles, AI is an integral part of the fitness industry. Even people also feel motivated to continue their workouts and physical activities as they can see their progress in real time. However, when it comes to efficiency, AI has not yet reached that position. It is an excellent tool for keeping a tab of your daily workout, but it is not able to guide or curate personal workouts for each individual. When you go to a fitness center, a trainer curates a tailored workout regime depending on your body structure, physiology, your current fitness, health issues, your diet, and many other things. But when you solely rely on your fitness app, which is driven by AI, it will not be able to recommend you a workout that is suitable for your body type. When you put certain information on the app, it will give you a generic plan that will help you to start your fitness journey. A personal fitness coach is still very much required if you want to amplify your fitness goals and follow a specific routine that would be beneficial for your health. So, AI can be a great addition to your fitness apps, but it will fail to give you authentic results. Professional training coaches understand the aspects of your physiology much better than AI and if you are looking to get healthier and fitter.'

  outertext : 'In our bustling and demanding culture, it’s easy to feel overworked and anxious. With all that is going on around us, it is more important than ever to take care of our mental health. Exercise is one of the best ways to do this. Physical activity has several benefits for our physical health, but it also has numerous benefits for our mental health.',
  innertext : 'Exercise has been found in studies to significantly improve mental health. It can elevate mood, lessen depressive and anxious symptoms, and even lessen stress. What sorts of workouts are most beneficial, and how does exercise accomplish these advantages? First, consider how exercise affects the brain. Endorphins are organic substances that produce a pleasurable, euphoric sensation when we exercise. Endorphins work with brain receptors to reduce pain and improve mood. Exercise also increases blood flow and oxygen levels in the brain, which helps to alleviate the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Let us now look at the workouts that are most effective for improving mental health. While any type of exercise can be beneficial, some routines are more effective. Aerobic activity, such as jogging or cycling, has been shown to be very beneficial for increasing mood and reducing symptoms of anxiety and sadness. Weightlifting and other types of muscular exercise can be beneficial to your mental health as well. According to research, resistance training may be as effective as drugs in lowering the symptoms of anxiety and depression in certain people. So let’s talk about the importance of consistency. If you want to reap the benefits of exercise on your mental health, make physical activity a regular part of your routine. Strive to exercise for at least 30 minutes five days a week. If you’ve never exercised before, start out cautiously and gradually increase the duration and intensity of your workouts. In conclusion, exercise has several, substantial advantages for mental health. Regular physical exercise can help elevate mood, lessen melancholy and anxiety symptoms, and reduce stress. Make exercise a regular part of your routine and pick exercises that are good for boosting mental health if you want to experience these advantages. Whatever your preferred kind of exercise is—running, weightlifting, yoga—it might make you feel better mentally. Hence, the next time you’re experiencing tension or anxiety, consider going for a run or working out in the gym. Your brain will be grateful.'

In this article, we will break stereotypes surrounding strength training and highlight how it can empower women to embrace their strength and transform their lives.',
  innertext : 'Dispelling Stereotypes: 1. Fear of Bulky Muscles : One common misconception is that strength training will make women look bulky. However, due to differences in hormones and genetics, women are unlikely to develop large muscles without specifically training for it. Instead, strength training helps to sculpt and tone the body, resulting in a lean and athletic physique. 2. Focus on Appearance : Strength training is not solely about aesthetics. It goes beyond the superficial and emphasizes building functional strength, improving overall health, and boosting self-confidence. Strength training enables women to feel powerful, capable, and in control of their bodies. Empowering Benefits of Strength Training : 1. Increased Strength and Functional Fitness : Strength training helps women develop strong muscles and a sturdy frame, allowing them to handle daily activities with ease. Lifting weights strengthens the muscles and connective tissues, improving overall functional fitness and making everyday tasks more manageable. 2. Improved Body Composition : Strength training aids in building lean muscle mass while reducing body fat. This leads to a more toned appearance and an increase in metabolic rate, allowing women to burn more calories throughout the day. A strong and well-defined physique can foster body positivity and self-acceptance. 3. Enhanced Bone Density : Women are at a higher risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures as they age. Strength training, particularly weight-bearing exercises, helps increase bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and maintaining strong, healthy bones. 4. Boosted Confidence and Mental Strength : Strength training promotes a sense of accomplishment and empowerment. As women witness their progress and realize their increasing strength, they develop greater confidence in their abilities, both inside and outside the gym. Strength training challenges the mind as well, building resilience and mental toughness. 5. Injury Prevention and Longevity : Strengthening the muscles and improving joint stability through strength training can significantly reduce the risk of injuries. It enhances joint integrity and supports proper body mechanics, contributing to overall longevity and well-being.'

Minimizing plastic, water, and paper waste. Some brands that prioritize sustainability in their equipment design include Precor, Life Fitness, and SportsArt. The first ecological gym in the world was opened in Oregon in 2008 by Adam Boesel, founder of The Green Microgym. Boesels challenge was to get as close as possible to energy self-sufficiency. Lower Your Carbon Footprint. One of the main benefits of going green is that it can help lower your carbon footprint. This means that you’ll be reducing your gym’s overall environmental impact by taking steps to reduce energy consumption and waste production. Some easy things you can do include replacing traditional lightbulbs with LED bulbs, using energy-efficient appliances, and finding ways to reduce or recycle paper waste like flyers and brochures. By doing these simple things, your gym can reduce its energy costs while helping out the environment at the same time! Save Money on Energy Bills. Another great benefit of going green is that it can save your gym money in the long run. For example, if you invest in Energy Star-certified appliances, they tend to use less electricity than regular models; this will result in lower monthly energy bills! Additionally, many utility providers offer discounts or rebates on certain energy-efficient products; so be sure to check with them to see what kind of savings opportunities are available to you.

  innertext : 'Sleep is important for physical performance and recovery after exercise. When you sleep, your body repairs and restores itself, which can improve your endurance, strength, and coordination. Sleep also helps your body produce growth hormone, which can help you grow. Sleep can also improve your mental and emotional performance. Without enough sleep, you may not be able to think clearly or react as quickly during training or games. You may also be more sensitive, moody, or irritable. Sleep deprivation can decrease the time it takes to become exhausted. Poor sleep can also lower the bodys levels of leptin, which alerts the brain when it has had enough food. Poor sleep can also increase levels of ghrelin, which stimulates appetite. Although a substantial body of literature has explored the relationship between sleep and exercise, comprehensive reviews and definitive conclusions about the impact of exercise interventions on sleep are lacking. Electronic databases were searched for articles published between January 2013 and March 2017. Studies were included if they possessed either objective or subjective measures of sleep and an exercise intervention that followed the guidelines recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine. Thirty-four studies met these inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine studies concluded that exercise improved sleep quality or duration; however, four found no difference and one reported a negative impact of exercise on sleep. Study results varied most significantly due to participants age, health status, and the mode and intensity of exercise intervention. Mixed findings were reported for children, adolescents, and young adults. Interventions conducted with middle-aged and elderly adults reported more robust results. In these cases, exercise promoted increased sleep efficiency and duration regardless of the mode and intensity of activity, especially in populations suffering from disease. Our review suggests that sleep and exercise exert substantial positive effects on one another; however, to reach a true consensus, the mechanisms behind these observations must first be elucidated.'

  innertext : 'Mindful movement is a type of exercise that involves moving your body while focusing on your sensations and emotions. It can include yoga, tai chi, walking, dancing, or stretching. The goal of mindful movement is to strengthen the mind-body connection, which can help lower stress and release stagnant energy. Yoga and mindfulness both aim to quiet the mind and cultivate a deeper connection to the self. When practicing yoga, you can move through each pose slowly and mindfully, taking time to notice your breath and how your body feels. This can help you develop a heightened sense of self-awareness, which can extend beyond the yoga mat. Yoga can restore balance and promote emotional well-being through mindful movement, breath control, and meditation. It helps us find inner peace and gain insight into our emotions. At the heart of yoga lies mindfulness - the art of being fully present at the moment. As we step onto the mat and engage in various yoga asanas, we learn to observe our thoughts and emotions without judgment. Through this awareness, we can consciously choose responses rather than impulsively to external triggers. The physical aspect of yoga plays a significant role in our emotional well-being. As we flow through postures, we release tension and stagnant energy, allowing the body to relax and renew. This physical release profoundly impacts our emotional state, promoting a sense of calmness and inner balance. One of the most potent tools within yoga is the breath. Deep, mindful breathing oxygenates our bodies and helps regulate our nervous system, reducing stress and anxiety. Through pranayama techniques, such as alternate nostril breathing or the calming ujjayi breath, we can create a calm and centered space, fostering emotional stability and resilience. So, dear friends, let us continue to explore the profound connection between yoga and emotional well-being. Together, lets embrace mindful movement, cultivate inner peace, and unlock the transformative power of yoga in our lives. '

Its vast, unspoilt beauty can be a balm for our hectic, urban lives, providing not only physical benefits but also acting as a natural salve for mental well-being.This article aims to explore the mental health benefits of outdoor activities and ways to incorporate them into your routine. Embracing the Healing Power of Nature Being cooped up inside four walls, glued to our screens, has become the new norm for many, with nature increasingly becoming an overlooked aspect of our lives. However, science has repeatedly shown that exposure to the outdoors can significantly improve mental health, leading to reduced stress, enhanced mood, increased creativity, and improved cognitive function. The Mental Health Benefits of Outdoor Activities Reduced Stress and Anxiety Studies have shown that spending time in natural settings can reduce the stress hormone cortisol and lower heart rate, thereby reducing feelings of stress and anxiety. Activities like walking, cycling, or even gardening in natural environments can provide relief from daily anxieties and offer a much-needed break from the noise and clutter of urban life. Improved Mood and Self-esteem The simple act of taking a walk in a park or forest can enhance mood and self-esteem. Green spaces provide a sense of calm and tranquillity, stimulating the release of endorphins, the bodys natural mood lifters. In addition, regular outdoor physical activities have been associated with lower risks of depression and improved overall mental health. Enhanced Creativity and Cognitive Function Nature can be a fantastic catalyst for creativity.

We stress ourselves out trying to emulate the same impossible feat, but I’m here to tell you that no matter how much you work out, you’re never going to look like them. You can get close, though, if you try. Start here with a few tips, and you’ll look Gwyneth Paltrow-esque in your skinny jeans in no time.',
  innertext : '1. Splurge Daily: Paltrows trainer and business partner, Tracy Anderson, gives all of us permission to not starve ourselves (um, thank you?). "Pick the meal that you enjoy the most, and let that be your one calorie splurge for that day,” says Anderson. She suggests cutting back on the other two meals with protein shakes or an energy bar (she happens to love Bliss Bar Superfood Energy Bars). 2. Snack Between Meals: You know how your mom used to be all, “Dont snack, or you’ll ruin your appetite!” And you were all, “But I’m so hungry!” Well, now you can tell your mom that Harley Pasternak -- trainer to Lady Gaga, Kanye West and Katy Perry and author of the Five Factor Diet -- says low-fat protein snacking is totally fine. Edamame and nonfat Greek yogurt with frozen berries are his favorite options. And in his book, he mentions salmon sashimi with plums and fresh figs with balsamic cream sauce. Yum. 3. Start Stripping: Apparently, actress Amy Adams hates the treadmill so much that she decided to go all stripper-pants on us to lose her baby weight. Yes, the woman known for her sweet and innocent roles (Enchanted; The Muppets) is down with pole dancing. And according to my insider sources (ahem, tabloids), Emma Watson, Cindy Crawford and Kate Hudson also named pole dancing as an integral part of their workouts. (Hudson reportedly even installed a pole in her bathroom. Dancing by the toilet sounds odd, but whatever works.). ust because celebs have fit bodies and cash to spare doesnt mean they all have live-in chefs keeping them on track. In fact, a lot of stars whip up their own food so they can maintain control over the ingredients and calories that go into their meals—and Kathy Kaehler is the women that shows them how to swing it. How do celebrities get fit so fast? Across the board, the trifecta of proper diet, regular exercise, and good sleep—especially when supported by a team of experts—helps actors achieve their physique goals fast.',
